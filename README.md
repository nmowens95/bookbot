# BookBot
This project is a Python text analyzer script that works with reading files. Currently the famous "Frankenstein" is the book used for text. BookBot looks over the entire text and comes up with a quick analysis of the contents.

## Why and what I learned
- This was my first project interacting with git to learn version control
- A small Python project on my computer, not an integrated site editor
- Work with reading files
- Came back and Dockerized to learn how to docker a Python based program

## Installation
Clone repo:
```bash
github.com/nmowens95/bookbot
```
Build && run in Docker:
```bash
docker build -t bookbot .
```
```bash

```
## Future/Contributions
- Add more books
- Add an integrated synopsis code
- Write synopsis to another file
