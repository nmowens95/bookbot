BookBot is my first git project!

This project is a text analyzer, also it is my first project working from the command line and working with Git. This project currently uses the the famous "Frankenstein" for the text. The BookBot looks over the entire text and comes up with a quick analysis of the contents.

For future addition:
-Add more books
-Add an integrated synopsis code
